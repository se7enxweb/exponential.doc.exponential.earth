<div class="attribute-heading">
<h1>Restoring content</h1>
</div>

 <p>The trash makes it possible to recover objects that were previously removed from the system. Whenever a node is about to be removed, Exponential will ask the user if the object that is associated with that node should be placed in the trash. If the &quot;Move to trash&quot; checkbox is checked, this is exactly what will happen. If not, the object will be lost forever. The contents of the trash can be inspected by accessing the &quot;Trash&quot; link which is located below the tree menu on the left. The following image shows the trash interface.</p> 
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/ez_publish/user_manual/3_6/images/daily_tasks/the_trash_interface/14617-1-eng-GB/the_trash_interface_doc.png" alt="The trash interface." />
 <p>The trash interface.</p>







</div> <p>Since the node (which contains information about the actual location of the object) is lost regardless of how you remove something, during recovery you will have to manually specify a new location for the object. The following text explains how you can recover an object from the trash.</p> 
<ol>
 <li><div> Bring up the trash interface by clicking the &quot;Trash&quot; link. The system will display a list of objects that have been put into the trash. </div></li> <li><div> Locate the object that you wish to put back into the node tree. </div></li> <li><div> Click the object's corresponding edit icon (on the right hand side). The system will bring up the <a href="../The-administration-interface/The-object-edit-interface.html" target="_self">object edit interface</a>. If you want, you can modify the contents of the object. </div></li> <li><div> Click the &quot;Send for publishing&quot; button. Since the system does not know where the object should be placed, it will ask for it by bringing up the browse interface. </div></li> <li><div> Use the browse interface to select a location where the object should be published. </div></li> <li><div> Click OK - the system will then create a node for the object and thus it will be put back into the tree and the restore operation will be completed. </div></li> 
</ol>
