<h1>User registration</h1>
</div>

<p>The user registration mechanism provides a form that allows new users to register themselves on the system. It can be reached by pressing the &quot;Register&quot; button on the login page. In order to register, the user must fill out the fields which are marked required and click the &quot;OK&quot; button. The following screenshot shows a filled out version of the registration form.</p>
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/screen_shot_2010_03_09_at_1_37_14_pm/108281-1-eng-GB/screen_shot_2010_03_09_at_1_37_14_pm.png" alt="" />








</div><a name="eztoc107776_0_1" id="eztoc107776_0_1"></a><h3>(1) - First name field</h3><p>This is where the user must enter his/her first name (for example &quot;John&quot;).</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_2" id="eztoc107776_0_2"></a><h3>(2) - Last name field</h3><p>This is where the user must enter his/her last name (for example &quot;Connor&quot;).</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_3" id="eztoc107776_0_3"></a><h3>(3) - User ID</h3><p>This number reveals the identification number of the user account that will be created.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_4" id="eztoc107776_0_4"></a><h3>(4) - User name field</h3><p>This is where the user must enter a desired user name (for example &quot;jconnor&quot;). The user name may consist of any character. This field is case insensitive, in other words &quot;JConnor&quot; will be the same as &quot;jconnor&quot;.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_5" id="eztoc107776_0_5"></a><h3>(5) - Password field</h3><p>This is where the user must enter a desired password (for example &quot;T-1000&quot;). The password must be at least three characters long. This field is case sensitive, in other words &quot;t-1000&quot; is not the same as &quot;T-1000&quot;.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_6" id="eztoc107776_0_6"></a><h3>(6) - Confirm password field</h3><p>This field must contain the exact same password that was typed into the password field. It allows the system to avoid scenarios where the user accidentally registers the account with a mistyped password.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_7" id="eztoc107776_0_7"></a><h3>(7) - E-mail field</h3><p>This is where the user must enter his/her E-mail address. The entered address will be used whenever Exponential attempts to communicate with the user. For example, the system will send the registration confirmation mail to this address.</p><p>Please note that the default behavior/configuration of Exponential does not allow multiple users to be registered with the exact same E-mail address.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_8" id="eztoc107776_0_8"></a><h3>(8) - Signature field</h3><p>This field is not required. It can for example be used to store additional information about the user.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_9" id="eztoc107776_0_9"></a><h3>(9) - Image cluster</h3><p>This interface allows the user to upload an image of himself/herself. An image can be selected by clicking the &quot;Choose&quot; button. Once an image has been selected, the &quot;New image file for upload&quot; field will contain the location and the name of the selected image. This field can also be filled out manually instead of using the convenience that the &quot;Choose&quot; button provides. The &quot;Alternative image text&quot; field allows the user to specify a short text that will be used whenever the image is not accessible or when the registered information is viewed in an alternate way (for example text-only).</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_10" id="eztoc107776_0_10"></a><h3>(10) - OK button</h3><p>This button allows the user to submit the registration form. Once the button is clicked, the system will attempt to register the user.</p><a name="eztoc107776_0_11" id="eztoc107776_0_11"></a><h3>(11) - Cancel button</h3><p>This button can be used to cancel the user registration. When clicked, the system will get rid of the entered information and bring the user back to the login page.</p><a name="eztoc107776_1" id="eztoc107776_1"></a><h2>Successful registration</h2><p>If all fields have been filled out correctly, the &quot;OK&quot; button is clicked and the system is able to register the new user account, the following dialog will be displayed:</p>
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/screen_shot_2010_03_09_at_1_42_00_pm/108284-1-eng-GB/screen_shot_2010_03_09_at_1_42_00_pm.png" alt="" />








</div><p>The newly generated user account will be disabled until the user checks his/her mail and clicks on the registration link. Once this link is accessed, the registered account will be activated. Newly registered accounts will be placed inside the &quot;Guest accounts&quot; user group which is located under the &quot;Users&quot; top level node:</p>
<div class="object-center doc">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/user-account-registered/120592-1-eng-GB/User-account-registered_doc.png" alt="" />








</div><p>If something goes wrong, the system will show an error message explaining what went wrong and what can be done in order to fix the problem.</p>
