<h1>Using the eZ Image Editor</h1>
</div>

<a name="eztoc134712_0_1" id="eztoc134712_0_1"></a><h3>Getting started</h3><p>eZ Image Editor supports editing of the image files supported in Exponential, currently .png, .jpg and .gif files. These will need to be stored in the Media library in the Administration interface. You may also edit image files used in other contexts, like in content objects as articles, galleries and so on. Files not already stored in the Media Library will have to be stored as described in Exponential <a href="../../../The-Administration-Interface/The-Media-library-tab.html" target="_blank">Media Library</a>.</p><p>The starting point to edit an image object is to locate the image either in the &quot;Content structure&quot; tab, in the &quot;Media library&quot;, or in the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab if you have used images there. When you have located the object that you need to edit, select the &quot;Edit&quot;-button in the Image section of the &quot;Object edit&quot; screen as shown in the screen below. You will see the preview of the image, along with the attributes of the image, the name, the type and size of the object.</p>
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/the-image-section-of-the-object-edit-screen2/134769-1-eng-GB/The-image-section-of-the-object-edit-screen_doc.png" alt="" />
<p>The image section of the object edit screen.</p>







</div><p>Press &quot;Edit&quot; to edit the object. This command will bring you into the eZ Image Editor. Press &quot;Remove image&quot; to remove it from Exponential. To upload a new file select &quot;Choose file&quot; and browse for the file.</p><p>Use the &quot;Alternative image text&quot; field when you need a description below your picture in its published state. &quot;Tags&quot; is used when you want to add a tag to the image, which will also be displayed in your web-site's tag cloud. This will make it easy to find tag related images with one click from the tag cloud.</p><a name="eztoc134712_0_2" id="eztoc134712_0_2"></a><h3>eZ Image Editor workspace</h3><p>Upon pressing &quot;Edit&quot; in the screen above you will be presented with the Image Editor workspace. The workspace consists of three parts that you may move and position to better fit your needs. In this document the &quot;Actions&quot; part of the Image Editor will be on the left side, and the &quot;Thumbnail&quot; will be on the right side. But you may position these as you see fit.</p><p>The workspace is shown in the screen below:</p>
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/the-image-editor-workspace/134772-1-eng-GB/The-Image-Editor-workspace_doc.png" alt="" />
<p>The Image Editor workspace.</p>







</div><p>When you select the actions on the left side, the right lower part of the workspace will change and display a field with the values you can manipulate or modify.</p><p><b>Note:</b> You can also couple/decouple the right part of the Image Editor screen by pressing the &quot;Up arrow&quot; or &quot;Down arrow&quot; next to &quot;Thumbnail&quot;. This allows you to put this part of the screen were you find it practical to keep it when you work on an image.</p>

You also have an &quot;Undo&quot; button to reverse previous actions, and a &quot;Redo&quot; button to redo or reinstate previous actions. The &quot;Zoom&quot; button is used to zoom the picture into a practical size to work with.</p><a name="eztoc134712_0_3_2" id="eztoc134712_0_3_2"></a><h4>Image</h4><p>In the &quot;Image&quot; section of the &quot;Actions&quot; toolbar you will find the tools to modify the image.

Adjustments include modifying the &quot;Contrast&quot;, Brightness&quot; and &quot;Black and White&quot; attributes, and filters include blending the pixels into each other with &quot;Pixelate&quot; and make an aging effect with &quot;Sepia&quot;.</p><a name="eztoc134712_0_3_4" id="eztoc134712_0_3_4"></a><h4>Working on an image</h4><a name="eztoc134712_0_3_4_1" id="eztoc134712_0_3_4_1"></a><h5>Example on how to work in the workspace</h5><p>When you select the actions on the left side, the right lower part of the workspace will change and display a field with the values you can manipulate or modify.
