<h1>Extension functionality</h1>
</div>

<p>At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to embed your custom RESTful interface into Exponential, to be further consumed by any 3rd party-service :</p>
<ul>
<li><div>mobile application</div></li><li><div>external business application</div></li><li><div>web service</div></li>
</ul>
<p>This lets you expose any service reading content (heading for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_self">full CRUD</a> support eventually ), as well as other, fully custom features, with direct access to about any Exponential feature, from PHP.</p><a name="eztoc121569_0_1" id="eztoc121569_0_1"></a><h3><b>Pre-requisites and target population</b></h3><p>
This tutorial is for developers who are keen on making their Exponential a REST engine for their specific needs. This 2nd developer preview follows a first one &lt;link&gt;, with which we recommend you to quickly get acquainted. Developer preview means that what you will learn in a few moments is necessarily going to evolve, change, maybe not only slightly. This is not a crystallized piece of knowledge, rather a intermediate (yet pretty advanced) deliverable in an iterative process. Let us all be agile !<br /><b>Important preliminary note</b>: We are highly recommending to setup REST layer in Virtual Host environment for this release. We are working on adding support for other environments as well. Stay tuned!</p><p>Read more on how to set-up your Exponential in <a href="../../Installation/Virtual-host-setup.html" target="_self">Virtual Host mode</a></p>
