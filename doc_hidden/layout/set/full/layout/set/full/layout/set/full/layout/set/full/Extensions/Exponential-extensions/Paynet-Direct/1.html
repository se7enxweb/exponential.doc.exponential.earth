 <p>This manual covers the &quot;Paynet Direct&quot; extension and explains how it can be installed, configured and tested. The &quot;Paynet Direct&quot; extension provides a direct interface to the online credit card payment system of <a href="http://www.paynet.no/" target="_blank">Paynet</a>. Paynet is a payment service provider that operates within the European market. Partnerships are made with the largest card payment companies in Norway as well as in other Nordic countries. Paynet supports all currencies for Visa and Mastercard. The default languages are Norwegian and English. Other languages are available upon request. The Paynet solutions are system-neutral and do not require any proprietary software on the client or the server side.</p> <p>The &quot;Paynet Direct&quot; extension plugs into the built-in <a href="../../../Exponential/Technical-manual/3.6/Concepts-and-basics/Webshop.html" target="_self">e-commerce engine</a> of Exponential and thus provides a seemless integration of Exponential and Paynet. The extension allows customers to purchase goods that are available in an Exponential web solution by making use of the services that Paynet provides. The following list outlines the topics that are covered by this manual.</p> <ul><li><a href="1.x/Requirements-and-preparation.html">Requirements and preparation</a></li><li><a href="1.x/Installation.html">Installation</a></li><li><a href="1.x/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></li><li><a href="1.x/Testing.html">Testing</a></li></ul>
 <p>Please note that the &quot;Paynet Direct&quot; extension does not redirect the customer to the Paynet site. In other words, the customer will always stay within the same domain/site (the Exponential web solution) and thus the payment is carried out in the smoothest possible way. The customer can be redirected to the Paynet site by making use of the <a href="../Paynet-Terminal.html" target="_self">&quot;Paynet Terminal&quot;</a> extension. Both extensions are included in the <a href="http://ez.no/download/add_ons/paynet_gateway" target="_blank">&quot;Paynet Gateway&quot; package</a>, which can be purchased from eZ Systems.</p>
