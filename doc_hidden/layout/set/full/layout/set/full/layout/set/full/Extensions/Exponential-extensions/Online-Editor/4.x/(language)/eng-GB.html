<div class="attribute-heading">
<h1>4.x</h1>
</div>

<p><b>This is documentation for Online Editor 4.x (ezdhtml) extension for Exponential 3.x, documentation on version provided with Exponential 4.x and Exponential 5.x (legacy) is moved to the <a href="../../../../../Exponential/User-manual/5.x/The-Online-Editor.html" target="_self">Exponential 5.x documentation</a>.</b></p><p>The Exponential Online Editor (OE for short) is an extension that allows you to create formatted pages using an intuitive interface. With the Online Editor you can easily format long passages of text for your articles, product descriptions, weblogs, etc. You can put your text into an <a href="../../../../../Exponential/Technical-manual/3.6/Reference/Datatypes/XML-block.html" title="Formatted text is stored in attributes/fields of the XML block datatype." target="_self">XML field</a>&nbsp;and then format the contents by using the OE interface which is very similar to the ones found in many word processors. There is no need to know XML or manipulate tags manually. Simply click the necessary buttons and the OE will automatically convert your instructions into valid <a href="../../../../../Exponential/Technical-manual/3.6/Reference/XML-tags.html" target="_self">Exponential XML code</a>. After <a href="../Installation.html" target="_self">installation</a>, the Online Editor becomes an integrated part of your administration interface. It will appear every time you edit text that is stored using the <a href="../../../../../Exponential/Technical-manual/3.6/Reference/Datatypes/XML-block.html" target="_self">XML block</a>&nbsp;datatype. The following screenshot shows the Online Editor in action:</p>
<div class="object-center linked">            <a href="../../../../../layout/set/full/Extensions/Exponential-extensions/Online-Editor/4.x/Images/oe_main.html" target="_self"><img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/extensions/online_editor/4_x/images/oe_main/14162-2-eng-GB/oe_main_doc.png" alt="" /></a>
 <p>The Online Editor.</p>







</div><p>NB!:&nbsp;In next generation of Exponential (6.x), we hope to deliver a semantic RichText editing solution that works as close to possible to what one would expect coming from desktop editor solutions like Word. However as of this writing (2013), todays browser based web editing solutions, including Online Editor, are not able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>Work exactly like Word; Display on the web has traditionally not had the same level of precision
<ul>
<li><div>For best result make sure you get a integration partner to tweak Online Editor settings + css, and your output templates + css to work as close to each other as possible.</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li><li><div>Accept any copy/paste content in any browser; Again not something browsers and browser based editing solutions have been traditionally cable of
<ul>
<li><div>If you get issues either enable paste button or make sure you copy as plain text, also worth consider trying another browser</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
