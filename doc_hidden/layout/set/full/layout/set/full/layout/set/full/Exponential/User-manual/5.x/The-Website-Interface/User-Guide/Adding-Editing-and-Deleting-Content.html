<div class="attribute-heading">
<h1>Adding, Editing and Deleting Content</h1>
</div>

<p>When you are logged in with a user account that belongs to the Editor or Administrator group, the Website Toolbar (shown below) is displayed on each page of the site.</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/website-toolbar/134098-1-eng-GB/Website-Toolbar_reference.jpg" alt="Website Toolbar" />
<p>Website Toolbar</p>







</div><p>The buttons available from the Website Toolbar vary depending on whether your user account belongs to the Editor or Administrator group. If it belongs to the Editor group, only buttons that are&nbsp; applicable in the current context are available. Also, the buttons displayed to editors are limited according to the rights granted to the Editor user group. (All buttons are displayed to users who belong&nbsp; to the Administrator user group.)</p><p>In addition to the buttons that are displayed, the content classes displayed in the dropdown list vary according to whether your user account belongs to an Editor or Administrator group. If you are logged in as an administrator, all content classes are displayed, regardless of whether or not the class can be displayed within the current context. (For example, when you are logged in as an administrator, you are allowed to create a blog post underneath a folder, even though a blog post can only be displayed by a blog container.) If you are logged in as an editor, only content classes relevant to the currently displayed object are displayed in the drop-down list. (For example, the Blog post content class is only shown in the drop-down list when a Blog content object is displayed.)</p><p>The Website Toolbar only displays the OpenOffice.org import / export buttons when you are viewing a content object that is a container for the Article content class. Refer to the “OpenOffice.org&nbsp; support” section for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><div>To add content: Browse to the page under which you want to add the new content, select the type of content you want to add from the drop-down list, then click the Create here button. (For&nbsp; more information, see the descriptions for the individual content classes below).</div></li><li><div>To edit content: Browse to the page that you want to change then click the Edit button. (For more information, see the descriptions for the individual content classes below).</div></li><li><div>To move content: Browse to the page that you want to move then click the Move button. (For more information, see the “Moving content” section).</div></li><li><div>To display content in more than one area of the site: Browse to the page you want to display then click the Add locations button. (For more information, see the “Displaying the same content in multiple locations” section).</div></li>
