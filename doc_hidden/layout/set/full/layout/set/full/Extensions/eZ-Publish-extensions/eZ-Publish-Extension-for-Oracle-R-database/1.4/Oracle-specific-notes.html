<h1>Oracle specific notes</h1>

<p>This section describes some Oracle specific terms and concepts mentioned in the documentation of the Exponential Extension for Oracle® Database. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">official documentation of Oracle</a> for more information.</p><p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Be aware of all the differences before migrating to Oracle, since it has several conceptual differences when comparing it to other database management systems like MySQL or&nbsp;PL/pgSQL. For example, in most part of DBMS consider a given number of characters (eg. 255) for field size limits. In Oracle a size in bytes is used instead. In oracle if you set a field's limit to 255 it will be size for the content in bytes, not the number or characters, since lots of characters can use more than 1 byte.</p><p>An Oracle database is a collection of specific files residing on disk (control files, redo log files, data files, undo files and temp files). Every running Oracle database is associated with an Oracle instance. When a database is started on a database server, Oracle allocates a memory area (SGA) and starts one or more background processes (SMON, PMON and others). This combination of processes and shared memory is called an <i>Oracle instance</i>. An instance only exists while it is up and running. A database is normally managed by one and only one instance.</p><p>In order to connect to an Oracle instance, a client needs a connect descriptor, which is a specially formatted description of the destination for a network connection. The &quot;tnsnames.ora&quot; file can be used to define net service names (often referred to as &quot;connect strings&quot;) as aliases for connect descriptors. Users initiate a connect request by passing a username and password along with a connect string using the following format: &quot;username/password@connect_string&quot;.</p><p>A <i>schema</i> is a named collection of objects (tables, indexes, procedures, etc.) associated with a user account. The word &quot;schema&quot; can also be used to refer to an Oracle account. Oracle database installations usually come with a default schema that can be accessed using &quot;scott&quot; as the username and &quot;tiger&quot; as the password.</p><p>An Oracle database is divided into one or more logical storage units called <i>tablespaces</i>. Tables and indexes are created within a particular tablespace. The primary tablespace in any database is the SYSTEM tablespace, which Oracle creates automatically when the database is created. This tablespace is always online when the database is open. You can assign each user a tablespace <i>quota</i> in order to limit the amount of space allocated for storage of the user's objects within the specified tablespace. By default, a user has no quota on any tablespace in the database. If the user has the privilege to create a schema object, you must assign a quota to allow the user to create objects.</p><p><i>SQL*Plus</i> is an Oracle command line tool for running SQL and PL/SQL commands. This utility is often used by database administrators and developers to interact with the Oracle database. SQL*Plus can be used interactively or through scripts.</p><p>Oracle stores a single hash for each username/password combination rather than just the password itself. The passwords are not encrypted but hashed (digested) using the realm information as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="_blank">salt</a>. This results in a fixed length string. Oracle provides a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5" target="_blank">MD5</a> generation functions included in the DBMS_OBFUSCATION_TOOLKIT PL/SQL package.</p>
