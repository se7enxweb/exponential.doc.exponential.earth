<h1>Bundled installation</h1>
</div>

 <p>A bundled installation contains everything that is needed for eZ publish to run and eZ publish itself. A bundle contains the following software:</p> 
<ul>
 <li><div> Apache (web server) </div></li> <li><div> PHP (server side scripting engine) </div></li> <li><div> MySQL (database server and client) </div></li> <li><div> ImageMagick (image conversion software) </div></li> <li><div> eZ publish </div></li> 
</ul>
 <p>All software included in a bundle is pre-compiled for the Intel x86 hardware architecture. The binaries/executables are dynamically linked to the shared libraries of the target operating system (Linux or Windows). Each bundle comes with an easy-to-use installer. The installer automatically sets up the additional software, which means that no manual configuration of Apache, PHP, MySQL and ImageMagick is needed. The contents of a bundle is put inside a temporary directory, totally isolated from the rest of the filesystem. The software included in the bundle can coexist with previously installed versions of Apache, PHP, MySQL, etc. Bundles are very easy to install and can be just as easily removed. Bundled installations are available for the following operating systems:</p> 
<ul>
 <li><div> Linux distributions (Debian/Gentoo/Mandrake/RedHat/SuSE/etc.) </div></li> <li><div> Microsoft Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP </div></li> 
</ul>
 <p>The bundles are designed for getting eZ publish up and running in the fastest possible way on a computer that doesn't have the required software installed. However, bundles are meant to be used for testing/demonstration purposes only. If you plan to use eZ publish for more than just testing, we recommend that you install it using the normal installation method, which is described under the Normal installation section. The next sections describe the necessary requirements, how to install, use and remove eZ publish bundles.</p>
