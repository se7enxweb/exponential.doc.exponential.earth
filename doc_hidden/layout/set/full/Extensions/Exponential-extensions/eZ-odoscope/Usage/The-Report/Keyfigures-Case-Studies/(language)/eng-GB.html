<a name="eztoc130117_0_1" id="eztoc130117_0_1"></a><h3>Case Study 1: Bounce Rate</h3><p>The bounce rate represents the percentage of visitors who entered the website and &quot;bounced&quot; (left) rather than continue viewing other pages of the website. It is given by the filter <b>&quot;Session Length = 1&quot;</b>.</p><p>Let's see a Case Study for the bounce rate.</p><p>We have set the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Time Period:</b> Last Month</div></li><li><div><b>Filtergroup:</b> Origin - Filter(s) selected: Europe</div></li><li><div><b>Keyfigure - Bounce Rate</b>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Filter: </b>Session Length = 1</div></li><li><div><b>Setting:&nbsp;</b>Active;</div></li><li><div><b>Indicator:</b> Green to Red</div></li><li><div><b>Percentage:</b> 0-10; 11-25; 26-100</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li><li><div><b>Usergroup:</b> Europe </div></li>
</ul>
<p>With this configuration we will be able to analyze the bounce rate for European users on the website.</p><p>After we put the above settings on place, we will have the following information on odoscope Explorer:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-keyfigure-study-12/129904-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Keyfigure-Study-1.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 1" />
<p>eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 1</p>







</div>
<ol>
<li><div><b>The Keyfigure Filter:</b> Selected when the keyfigure was created;</div></li><li><div><b>The Keyfigure Indicator and Percentage:</b> The indicator will be red or green, according to the percentages you defined previously, when creating the keyfigure for the intervals. The percentage is always 100%, as each keyfigure is set upon ONE filter, so all the traffic will be shown on the selected filter. As you can see, the filter &quot;1&quot; shows 100%. This is the filter we chose for our keyfigure;</div></li><li><div><b>The Filter(s):</b> Manually selected - Europe;</div></li><li><div><b>The Filter(s) Indicator and Percentage:</b> The indicator will be red or green, according to the percentages you defined previously, when creating the keyfigure for the intervals. The percentage is calculated according to the the Keyfigure Filter and the Filtergroup Filter. In this scenario, it is quite simple</div></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><div>We can select just one Filter for the Keyfigure so, only the traffic filtered by this specific filter is considered when calculating the Keyfigure correlation. We can see in the column <b>&quot;Visits&quot;</b> that there were <b>13.602 visitors</b> who had just one interaction with the website analyzed. It represents <b>61.13% of the overall amount</b> of visitors in the time period selected, for Europe;</div></li><li><div>We have set only one Filter, so only the traffic filtered by it is considered when calculating the Filter percentage. Now, as our Keyfigure is <b>Active</b>, this value will be the same as shown for the Keyfigure, which in this case is <b>61.13%</b>. If the Keyfigure was <b>Inactive</b>, the percentage would be calculated by the formula: <b>(1-0,6113)*100</b>, which is <b>38.87%</b>.</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember what Active and Inactive sets mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Active set:</b> 61,13% of all visitors had 1 Interaction with the website (keyfigure filter)</div></li><li><div><b>Inactive set:</b> 38,87% of all visitors had more than 1 one interaction (all the other filters)</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Now take a look at the following scenario:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-bounce-rate/130121-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Bounce-Rate_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Bounce Rate" />
<p>eZ odoscope Bounce Rate</p>







</div><p>We have added some more filters to our Filtergroup (Origin), and the correlation between the Keyfigure and the &quot;Europe&quot; filter has not changed, which means: from the total amount of visits from Europe, 61.13% bounced. As you can see, only the percentage of visits has changed, as we added more visits to the overall amount of visitors (by selecting other filters: North America, Asia, Africa, Oceania and South America).</p><p>Now, if we change the keyfigure to &quot;Inactive&quot;, we will see the following results:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-bounce-rate-inactive2/130127-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Bounce-Rate-Inactive_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Bounce Rate Inactive" />
<p>eZ odoscope Bounce Rate Inactive</p>







</div><p>These are the results for the Inactive setting, which gives you the percentages for the 'rest of the filters' - visitors that did not bounce.</p><a name="eztoc130117_0_2" id="eztoc130117_0_2"></a><h3>Case Study 2: Lead Traffic Rate</h3><p>The lead traffic rate represents the percentage of users visiting certain goals or lead pages. It is given by any filter available on the <b>filtergroup LeadForms</b>.</p><p>Let's see a Case Study for the lead traffic rate:</p><p>We want to know <b>how many visitors</b> from all segments (<b>&quot;All Users&quot;)</b>, detailed by <b>origin</b>, did not click on any form available in our website in the last 90 days. We need to assess the effectiveness of a campaign we launched three months ago, to improve website usage.</p><p>We have set the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Time Period:</b> Last 90 days</div></li><li><div><b>Filtergroup:</b> Origin </div></li><li><div><b>Keyfigure - Lead Traffic Rate</b>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Filter: </b>LeadForms = Not Set</div></li><li><div><b>Setting: </b>Active</div></li><li><div><b>Indicator:</b> Green to Red</div></li><li><div><b>Percentage:</b> 0-25; 26-50; 51-100</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li><li><div><b>Usergroup:</b> All Users </div></li>
</ul>
<p>After setting this configuration up, we have the following results:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-keyfigure-study-22/130136-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Keyfigure-Study-2_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 2" />
<p>eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 2</p>







</div><p><b>Data Analysis:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><div>A <b>total</b> of <b>929 visitors</b> entered the website using mobile devices and <b>96.56%</b> (<b>897 visitors</b>) were filtered by the <b>&quot;Not Set&quot;</b> filter (<b>Our Lead Traffic Rate keyfigure</b>), which means that almost all our visitors did not access any of our forms;</div></li><li><div>We had some visitors who clicked in some of our forms, as for example: 
<ul>
<li><div><b>Download the Exponential Enterprise 30 Day Trial</b>: <b>12 visitors</b>, which represents <b>1.29% of the overall amount of visitors</b>;</div></li><li><div>&nbsp;<b>Demo Request</b>: <b>10 visitors</b>, which represents <b>1.08% of the overall amount of visitors</b>;</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>If you sum all percentages, you will get 100%.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><div>From all our visitors, from all regions of the globe (all origins), we had: 
<ul>
<li><div><b>539 visitors from Europe</b>, which represents <b>58.02% of the overall amount of visitors</b> (929). From 539 visitors, <b>95.36% did not access any of our forms</b> which is <b>513 visitors</b>;</div></li><li><div>278 visitors from North America, which represents 29.92% <b>of the overall amount of visitors</b> (929). From 278, <b>98.56% did not access any of our forms</b> which is <b>274 visitors</b>;</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Hints: </b>To see the percentage of users who clicked on a form, set the Keyfigure to Inactive. To see the accesses to other forms, change the keyfigure filter to any of the forms available on the filtergroup LeadForms. To see data for a specific segment, select or create a new Usergroup.</i></p><a name="eztoc130117_0_3" id="eztoc130117_0_3"></a><h3>Case Study 3: Internal Search Rate</h3><p>The internal search rate represents the percentage of visitors searching on the internal search bar of your website. It is given by any filter available on the <b>filtergroup KeywordIntern</b>.</p><p>Let's see a Case Study for the internal search rate regarding <b>Exponential website</b>.</p><p>We want to know the percentage of visitors that are using the internal search bar of the website:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-keyfigure-study-3/130139-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Keyfigure-Study-3_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 3" />
<p>eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 3</p>







</div><p>We have set the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Time Period:</b> Last 90 days</div></li><li><div><b>Filtergroup:</b> Origin </div></li><li><div><b>Keyfigure - Internal Search Rate</b>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Filter: KeywordIntern</b> = Not Set</div></li><li><div><b>Setting: </b>Inactive</div></li><li><div><b>Indicator:</b> Red to Green</div></li><li><div><b>Percentage:</b> 0-20; 21-50; 51-100</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li><li><div><b>Usergroup:</b> All Mobile Devices</div></li>
</ul>
<p>After setting this configuration up, we have the following results:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-keyfigure-study-33/130145-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Keyfigure-Study-3_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 3" />
<p>eZ odoscope Keyfigure Study 3</p>







</div><p><b>Data Analysis:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><div>A <b>total</b> of <b>929 visitors</b> entered the website using mobile devices and <b>1.29%</b> (<b>897 visitors</b>) were filtered by the <b>&quot;Not Set&quot;</b> filter (<b>Our Internal Search Rate keyfigure</b>), which means only a few of all our visitors used the internal Search Bar;</div></li><li><div>We had some visitors who did search, as for example: 
<ul>
<li><div><b>Etna</b>, which represents <b>0.11% of the overall amount of searches</b>;</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Hint:</b> As you can see, the &quot;KeywordIntern&quot; has several filters, distributed through several pages (<b>61 pages</b>). Use the little arrows shown at the right side of&nbsp; the filtergroup name to navigate between the pages and see more results.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><div>From all our visitors, from all mobile devices, we had: 
<ul>
<li><div><b>443 visitors accessed the website through iPhone</b>, which represents <b>47.69% of the overall amount of visitors</b> (929). From <b>443</b> visitors, <b>1.29% used the internal search feature,</b> which is <b>5 visitors</b>; fil</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Hints: </b>To see the percentage of users who used the internal search, set the Keyfigure to Inactive. To see the searches for other words, change the keyfigure filter to any of the words available on the filtergroup KeywordIntern. To see data for a specific segment, select or create a new Usergroup.</i></p><a name="eztoc130117_0_4" id="eztoc130117_0_4"></a><h3>More Examples:</h3>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Mobile Traffic Rate:</b> SetUp in Filtergroup ‘Operating System’ – create keyfigure on Subgroup ‘Mobile Devices’ and set active;</div></li><li><div><b>Traffic Coming from Google:</b> SetUp in Filtergroup ‘Referrer’ – create keyfigure on subgroup ‘Google’ and set active;</div></li><li><div><b>Direct Traffic Rate (typing the website url directly in the browser or visiting the website via bookmark):</b> SetUp in Filtergroup ‘Referrer’ – create keyfigure on ‘Not Set’ and set active;</div></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create an infinite number of combinations with filters, usergroups and keyfigures to analyze data from different time periods, according to what you have in mind and to your business needs.</p>
