    <h1>Requirements for doing a normal installation</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>Exponential makes use of and depends on five important things:</p=
>
<ol>
<li>
<div>
A web server
</div></li>
<li>
<div>
The server-side PHP scripting engine
</div></li>
<li>
<div>
A database server
</div></li>
<li>
<div>
An image conversion system (optional)
</div></li>
<li>
<div>
The Zeta Components library
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>The first three things should be in place before an Exponential installat=
ion is deployed. The image conversion system is optional and is only needed=
 if you're planning to use Exponential with images. The web server and the s=
erver-side PHP scripting engine have to run on the same machine. The databa=
se server may run on a different computer.</p>
<p>Please visit the <a href=3D"/display/EZP51/Requirements">requirements pa=
ge</a> to check if your platform fully supports installing Exponential, then=
 come back for the extra details which follow.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Webserver">Web server</h2=
>
<p>Currently, only the <a href=3D"http://httpd.apache.org/" class=3D"extern=
al-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Apache </a>web server is supported. On Linux/UNIX=
 based systems, it is recommended to use the latest version of the 2.2.x br=
anch (applies also to cluster mode). Note that it must run in "prefork" mod=
e instead of "threaded" mode - the reason for this is because some of the l=
ibraries that PHP extensions use might not be thread-safe.</p>
<p>Nginx and Lighttpd are known to work as well but are currently not suppo=
rted. "Rewrite" rules for those web servers can be found online, f.e. on th=
e forums on <a href=3D"http://share.ez.no" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"n=
ofollow">share.ez.no</a>.</p>
<p>On Windows, it is recommended to use MS IIS 7 or higher (with Microsoft =
URL Rewrite Module 1.1 or higher). Apache 2.x for Windows is not supported =
since it only exists in "threaded" mode.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Server-sidePHPscriptingen=
gine">Server-side PHP scripting engine</h2>
<p>PHP is free software and can be downloaded from <a href=3D"http://www.ph=
p.net" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">http://www.php.net</a>. The=
 full list of extensions needed can be found on the <a href=3D"/display/EZP=
51/Requirements">requirements page</a>. Info on some caveats can be found b=
elow:</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Zlibextension">Zlib exten=
sion</h3>
<p>Make sure that zlib support in PHP is enabled, otherwise the <a href=3D"=
/display/EZP51/The+setup+wizard">setup wizard</a> will not be able to unpac=
k downloaded packages during the installation process.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-DOMextension">DOM extensi=
on</h3>
<p>In most cases, <a href=3D"http://www.php.net/dom" class=3D"external-link=
" rel=3D"nofollow">DOM functions</a> are enabled by default as they are inc=
luded in the PHP core. However, some Linux distributions have PHP without c=
ompiled-in support for DOM. Instead, they provide DOM as a shared module in=
 a separate RPM package called "php-xml".</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-PHPCLI">PHP CLI</h3>
<p><a name=3D"eztoc131654_2_4" rel=3D"nofollow"></a>Since version 5.0, it i=
s necessary to have <a href=3D"http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.comman=
dline.php" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">PHP CLI</a> installed, =
as using php from the command line is needed during the setup process. Also=
, some features like <a href=3D"http://doc.ez.no/Exponential/Technical-manua=
l/5.x/Features/Notifications" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">noti=
fications</a>, delayed search indexing, upgrade scripts, the collaboration =
system (content approval), clearing caches from within the command line, et=
c. will not work without php cli access.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-CURL">CURL</h3>
<p>It is recommended to enable <a href=3D"http://www.php.net/curl" class=3D=
"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">CURL</a> support, otherwise some features =
like <a href=3D"http://doc.ez.no/Exponential/Technical-manual/4.x/Reference/=
Configuration-files/site.ini/ProxySettings/ProxyServer" class=3D"external-l=
ink" rel=3D"nofollow">outbound connections via proxy</a> and <a href=3D"htt=
p://pubsvn.ez.no/nextgen/trunk/doc/features/3.8/ssl_enhancement_with_ezsoap=
client.txt" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">SSL support for eZSoap=
</a> will not work.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-PHPmemorylimitissue">PHP =
memory limit issue</h3>
<p>Exponential needs at least 64 MB of memory in order to complete the setup=
 wizard. Normal operation requires about 32 MB. However, it is highly recom=
mended that you keep the 64 MB setting since Exponential consumes a lot more=
 memory as you reindex the content, execute upgrade scripts, etc. Multiling=
ual sites will also require at least 64 MB.</p>
<p>As of PHP 5.2.1 and later, there is no need to change the default "<code=
>memory_limit</code>" setting (it is set to 128 MB by default), but make su=
re to check your setup anyway.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-PHPtimezone">PHP timezone=
</h3>
<p>You need to set the "<a href=3D"http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.datetim=
e.php#ini.date.timezone" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">date.time=
zone</a>" value in the "<code>php.ini</code>" configuration file. If this s=
etting is not specified, you will most likely receive error messages like "=
It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings" when running eZ P=
ublish on PHP 5. The following example shows how the corresponding line in =
"<code>php.ini</code>" looks like:</p>
<div class=3D"preformatted panel" style=3D"border-width: 1px;">
<div class=3D"preformattedContent panelContent">=20
<pre>date.timezone =3D &lt;timezone&gt;</pre>=20
</div>
</div>
<p>Refer to the <a href=3D"http://www.php.net/timezones" class=3D"external-=
link" rel=3D"nofollow">PHP documentation</a> for the list of supported time=
zones. Don't forget to restart Apache after editing "<code>php.ini</code>".=
</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-"><a name=3D"eztoc131654_=
3" rel=3D"nofollow"></a></h3>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Sessionparameters">Sessio=
n parameters</h3>
<p>Exponential sessions are handled by the Symfony stack, through session ha=
ndlers. For that to be set up, additional&nbsp;<code>yml</code>&nbsp;config=
uration are required, which you can find in the&nbsp;<a href=3D"/display/EZ=
P51/Session">Session</a> chapter.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Otherphpconfigurationsett=
ings">Other php configuration settings</h3>
<p>See the <a href=3D"http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/requirements=
.html" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Symfony documentation</a> f=
or the recommended <code>php.ini</code> settings for Symfony, as well as th=
e<a href=3D"https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP/Virtual+host+example" clas=
s=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow"> Vhost example</a> for the recommended=
 <code>php.ini</code> settings for Exponential.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-ZetaComponentslibrary">Ze=
ta Components library</h2>
<p>Zeta Components (formerly eZ Components) is an enterprise-ready, general=
 purpose library of PHP components which can be used used independently or =
together for PHP application development. They can be downloaded from <a hr=
ef=3D"http://ezcomponents.org/download" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofo=
llow">http://ezcomponents.org/download</a>, or installed using different me=
thods such as Pear, Composer, Github etc... The <a href=3D"http://ezcompone=
nts.org/docs/install" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">online docum=
entation</a> has detailed instructions on installing them on the webserver.=
</p>
<p>The correct version of the Zeta Components required for running eZ Publi=
sh always comes bundled with Exponential package itself, so there is no need=
 to install them separately.</p>
<p>It is possible to use a single instance of the Zeta Components library a=
nd share it between multiple installations of Exponential. Such configuratio=
n is complex and falls outside the scope of this document.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Databaseserver">Database =
server</h2>
<p>Exponential stores miscellaneous data structures and actual content using=
 a relational database. This means that a database server has to be availab=
le for Exponential at all times. Follow this link to the Exponential <a href=
=3D"http://doc.ez.no/Exponential/Technical-manual/5.x/Installation/Normal-in=
stallation/Requirements-for-doing-a-normal-installation" class=3D"external-=
link" rel=3D"nofollow">requirements page</a> to find which database solutio=
ns Exponential is compatible with.</p>
<p>Exponential 5 requires a UTF-8 database and support for transactions, whi=
ch for MySQL means using the <code><a href=3D"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refm=
an/5.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofoll=
ow"> InnoDB</a></code> storage engine.</p>
<p>The setup wizard will automatically detect the database server during op=
eration of the setup wizard if it is running on the same computer that oper=
ates as web server.</p>
<p>Note that Exponential 5 does not support <a href=3D"http://doc.ez.no/eZ-P=
ublish/Technical-manual/5.x/Features/Clustering" class=3D"external-link" re=
l=3D"nofollow">clustering</a> mode for PostgreSQL databases. The clustering=
 code is optimized for best performance on MySQL databases using the <code>=
<a href=3D"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.htm=
l" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow"> InnoDB</a></code> storage engi=
ne.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-MySQL">MySQL</h3>
<p>Even if you are not going to run Exponential in a clustered environment, =
the use of <code>InnoDB</code> is required. This storage engine makes it po=
ssible to use transaction-safe tables in a MySQL database. (Database transa=
ction support is enabled by default in Exponential. This feature makes the s=
ystem less vulnerable to database errors and inconsistencies due to aborted=
 requests.) Contact your database administrator if you are unsure about whe=
ther <code>InnoDB</code> is available on your server.</p>
<p>MySQL can be tweaked with a lot of settings, but one setting which is re=
quired to set to a higher value is&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://dev.mysql.com/doc=
/refman/5.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size" class=
=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">innodb_buffer_pool_size</a> , by defaul=
t it is set to 8mb, but it needs at least to be set to 128mb, or as the mys=
ql doc says up to 80% of system memory on dedicated database server.</p>
<p><strong>Known issue with running PHP5.3 on MySQL:</strong>&nbsp;Some peo=
ple (like Windows users with both IPv4 and IPv6 installed ) experience prob=
lems connecting to the database server using host names like "<code>localho=
st</code>"... If you experience problems, try using IPv4 address like "<cod=
e>127.0.0.1</code>". This is due to a connectivity problem when running PHP=
5.3 on MySQL. So, please replace the database server name "<code>localhost<=
/code>" with the IP address of the machine, or "<code>127.0.0.1</code>", wh=
ich is reserved for the local host.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-PostgresSQL">PostgresSQL<=
/h3>
<p>If you want to use PostgreSQL, make sure the "<code><a href=3D"http://ww=
w.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/pgcrypto.html" class=3D"external-link" rel=
=3D"nofollow">pgcrypto</a></code>" module is installed. On Linux/UNIX, you =
may need to install a separate package called "<code>postgresql-contrib</co=
de>" (refer to the <a href=3D"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/con=
trib.html" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">PostgreSQL documentatio=
n</a> for more information), which contains the "<code>pgcrypto</code>" mod=
ule. The "<code>pgcrypto</code>" module provides cryptographic functions fo=
r PostgreSQL, including the "digest" function, which is needed for eZ Publi=
sh. When setting up a PostgreSQL database for Exponential, you will have to =
register these functions in the database. Refer to the "Setting up a databa=
se" part of the "<span class=3D"confluence-link">&nbsp;</span><a href=3D"/d=
isplay/EZP51/Installing+eZ+Publish+on+a+Linux-UNIX+based+system"><span clas=
s=3D"confluence-link">Installing Exponential on a Linux/UNIX based system</s=
pan></a>" and "<a href=3D"/display/EZP51/Installing+eZ+Publish+on+Windows">=
<span class=3D"confluence-link">Installing Exponential on Windows</span></a>=
" documentation pages (depending on the target OS) for more information.</p=
>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Imageconversionsystem(opt=
ional)">Image conversion system (optional)</h2>
<p>In order to resize, convert or modify images, Exponential needs to make u=
se of an image conversion system. One of the following software packages (b=
oth are free) can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
GD2 (comes with PHP)
</div></li>
<li>
<div>
ImageMagick (
<a href=3D"http://www.imagemagick.org" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofol=
low">http://www.imagemagick.org</a>)
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>ImageMagick supports more formats than GD and usually produces better re=
sults (better scaling, etc.). The setup wizard will automatically detect th=
e pre-installed image conversion system(s).</p>
<p>The installation and setup of required software solutions (outlined abov=
e) is far beyond the scope of this document. Please refer to the homepage a=
nd documentation of the different software solutions.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Limitationonsomefilesyste=
mswhenstoringlargenumberofcontentfiles">Limitation on some file systems whe=
n storing large number of content files</h2>
<p>Exponential stores all binary content (e.g. images, PDFs etc) on disc in =
<code>var/storage</code> using a similar folder structure to the content tr=
ee, creating one folder for each object. In most file systems used under Li=
nux (especially ext2 + ext3) there is a hard limit of 32.000 to the maximum=
 number of sub-folders which can be created in one folder. This means that =
it is not possible to store more than 31999 objects under one parent object=
.</p>
<p>To get around this limitation without changing the file system, you can =
split your content tree so that you don't have more than 32k content files =
(example: images) in the same folder.</p>
<p>Other file systems support more file/folder entries per folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4: 64.000</li>
<li>ReiserFS: roughly 1.2 million</li>
<li>ZFS: 2^48 (a really big number: 281474976710656)!</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that those filesystems might not be fully supported by Exponential, =
please check out the <a href=3D"/display/EZP51/Requirements">requirements p=
age</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-ExponentialonNFSfilesystems=
">Exponential on NFS file systems</h2>
<p>Please be aware that it's not advisable to run Exponential on NFS file sy=
stems as you may experience issues. The cause of the issues may be performa=
nce, as NFS will slow down on heavy network traffic, slow access to files, =
or file access concurrency regarding file lock. Also, Exponential currently =
uses the&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://php.net/manual/en/function.flock.php" title=
=3D"flock() PHP function" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">flock()<=
/a>&nbsp;PHP function, which is not considered stable for NFS shares.</p>
<p>NFS should only be used to store distributed data such as cache, or bina=
ry files,&nbsp;in clustered environments.</p>
<h2 id=3D"Requirementsfordoinganormalinstallation-Networkconnectivity">Netw=
ork connectivity</h2>
<p>During execution of the setup wizard, the web server will need to downlo=
ad some content from the internet.</p>
<p>If the web server can not access directly the internet, or if it has to =
go through a proxy, workarounds have to be taken. See the <a href=3D"/displ=
ay/EZP51/The+setup+wizard">setup wizard</a> documentation page for possible=
 workarounds</p>
